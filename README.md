# CHIP-8
A CHIP-8 interpreter implemented in Python with a Pygame interface.

# About
This emulator runs CHIP-8 games and programs in a 640x320 window. 

# Usage
Run with a CHIP-8 rom:
```
python main.py [file name]
```

# Resources
While working on this project, I constantly referred to [this](http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html) documentation of the CHIP-8 language. Please consult [this](http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) detailed guide if you want to try making your own CHIP-8 emulator.
